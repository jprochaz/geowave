= GeoWave Standalone Installer 

== Introduction

The Standalone Installer is designed to allow a user to run end-to-end tests of the GeoWave capabilities on a personal computer.  GeoWave's primary strength is with massive datasets that would typically require a distributed cluster of computers.  While GeoWave supports a number of key/value data stores, the installer only bundles embedded versions of Redis, RocksDB, Apache HBase(TM) and Apache Accumulo(TM).

The Standalone installer uses https://www.ej-technologies.com/products/install4j/overview.html[Install4J] to build multi-platform installers.  Installation requires ~900Mb of disk space and 8Gb of memory.
